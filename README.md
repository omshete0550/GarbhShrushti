## About The Project

**Problem Statement**

Maternal and child health is a critical concern in many parts of the world, including India. Despite significant progress in recent years, there are still challenges related to maternal mortality, infant mortality, and overall maternal and child well-being. Key issues include inadequate access to quality healthcare, nutrition, immunisation, and prenatal care, which can result in adverse health outcomes for mothers and children. Create a platform that addresses maternal and child health by implementing comprehensive interventions and software
solutions to improve healthcare access, awareness, and outcomes for mothers and children.

<br />

**Features**

1. Provide prenatal care information, checklists, appointment
reminders, and educational resources about nutrition, hygiene,
and prenatal health.
2. Create a digital health record system for pregnant women
that tracks their health status, prenatal visits, and vital signs,
ensuring timely interventions and reducing maternal
complications.
3. Implement an immunization tracking feature that reminds
parents about their child's vaccination schedule, provides
information on vaccine safety, and connects them to nearby
vaccination centers.
4. Develop a nutrition and growth tracking feature that allows
parents to monitor the growth and nutritional status of infants
and young children, providing guidance on appropriate feeding
practices.
5. Implement an emergency response feature in the app,
allowing users to request immediate medical assistance in
cases of complications during pregnancy or childbirth.
6. Encourage community participation by creating a social
platform within the app where users can connect, share
experiences, and support one another.
